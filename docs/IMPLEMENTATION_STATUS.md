# Implementation Status

## Work Package 001 — Application Shell + Dashboard

Status: Implemented

Tasks:

* STUDIO-TASK-000001 — Application Shell — Complete
* STUDIO-TASK-000002 — Dashboard — Complete

---

## What Exists

* Application shell: top toolbar, permanent left Navigation Rail (SDD-003),
  central Primary Workspace, bottom Status Bar (SDD-004 regions in scope
  for this work package).
* Routing via `go_router`, one route per navigation destination, all
  rendered inside a single persistent shell (`ShellRoute`). Only one
  Primary Workspace is visible at a time; navigation never opens a
  floating window, per SDD-003/SDD-004.
* Placeholder pages for Repository, Objects, Relationships, Search,
  Graph, Validation, Packages, and Settings.
* Dashboard implementing the approved `001-OEP-STUDIO-DASHBOARD-v1.0`
  mockup: Welcome header, Open Repository, Create Repository,
  Repository Status, Recent Repositories, Foundation Version,
  Installed Packages, and Getting Started, all with placeholder /
  disconnected-state data.
* Dark theme (SDD-002 Design Language): single sans-serif family,
  status-communicating color palette, monospace style reserved for
  technical data.
* `flutter_riverpod` wired at the app root (`ProviderScope`); no
  providers are defined yet — Work Package 001 has no state to manage
  beyond navigation, which `go_router` owns.

## What Is Explicitly Not Implemented

Per Work Package 001's architecture rules:

* `lib/core/foundation/` — Foundation Bridge — placeholder only, no
  FFI code.
* `lib/core/services/` — Studio Services — placeholder only.
* `lib/core/models/` — placeholder only.
* No Foundation references, no FFI, no engineering business logic
  anywhere in `lib/`.

## Repository Structure

```

    widgets/            StudioNavRail, StudioToolbar, StudioStatusBar
  core/
    foundation/         Foundation Bridge — placeholder (SDD-006)
    models/              Studio domain models — placeholder
    routing/             StudioDestination enum, go_router config
    services/            Studio Services — placeholder (SDD-001/004)
    theme/                StudioColors, StudioTheme (SDD-002)
  features/

    repository/          Placeholder
    objects/             Placeholder
    relationships/        Placeholder
    search/               Placeholder
    graph/                 Placeholder

    settings/              Placeholder
  shared/
    widgets/              DashboardCard, PlaceholderWorkspace, ResponsiveCardGrid
```

`features/*` never imports `core/foundation` directly — only
`core/services` would, once implemented. This boundary is enforced by
folder convention today; nothing in this work package crosses it since
`core/services` has no Foundation-facing code yet.

## Verification

Environment note: this environment had no Flutter SDK installed at
the start of this work package. Flutter 3.44.6 (stable) was installed
via `git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable` to
`C:\flutter` and added to PATH before any verification below was run.

* `flutter analyze` — no issues found.
* `flutter test` — 1/1 passing (`test/widget_test.dart`: app launches
  on the Dashboard, navigates to Settings via the rail, placeholder
  page renders).
* `flutter build windows` — succeeded;
  `build\windows\x64\runner\Release\oep_studio.exe` produced.
* Manual launch on Windows desktop — confirmed: app opens directly to
  the Dashboard, dark theme renders, Navigation Rail highlights the
  active destination, clicking a destination swaps the Primary
  Workspace and updates the Toolbar title with no floating window
  created.
* Manual resize — confirmed at 1000×720 (below the Dashboard's
  900px wide-layout breakpoint): the three-column card grid collapses
  to a single column, and the Toolbar/Status Bar shrink without
  overflow (both were fixed to use `Expanded`/`Flexible` and
  horizontally-scrollable regions after `flutter test`'s default
  800×600 surface first caught a `RenderFlex` overflow in all three —
  see Flutter-Specific Recommendations).

## Architectural Observations

* SDD-004 Workspace Framework lists five regions (Top Toolbar,
  Navigation Rail, Primary Workspace, Property Inspector, Status Bar).
  Work Package 001 scoped four of the five — Property Inspector is
  intentionally absent, matching both the work package's explicit
  requirements list and the approved Dashboard mockup, which does not
  show one. Flagging this so it is not mistaken for an oversight when
  Property Inspector is implemented in a later work package.
* `docs/UI_MOCKUPS.md` now records mockup status: 001 (Dashboard) and
  002 (Application Shell) are approved; the earlier tabbed/docked "IDE
  Shell Concept" is explicitly archived. This resolves the
  single-workspace-vs-tabs ambiguity flagged during the architecture
  review — SDD-004's single-workspace model is confirmed authoritative.
* The Foundation Bridge's eventual FFI implementation still has
  nothing to bind to: `oep_foundation/platform/api` (Public C API) and
  `specifications/sdk` remain placeholders as of this work package.
  This does not block Work Package 001 (no FFI is implemented here)
  but will block the first real Foundation Bridge work package until
  Foundation exposes a flat C ABI.

## Flutter-Specific Recommendations

* Keep `StudioDestination` as the single source of truth for
  navigation — the rail, router, and any future command palette should
  all read from it rather than duplicating the destination list.
* The Dashboard, Toolbar, and Status Bar were all initially written
  with fixed-width `Row` layouts and overflowed under `flutter test`'s
  default 800×600 surface. All three were corrected to shrink
  gracefully (`Expanded`/`Flexible`/`TextOverflow.ellipsis`, and
  horizontally-scrollable regions for the toolbar action group and
  status bar). Any new toolbar- or status-bar-style widget should be
  built and tested at a narrow width from the start rather than
  discovered via overflow errors later — Windows desktop windows are
  user-resizable down to very small sizes.
* `ResponsiveCardGrid` is a minimal hand-rolled solution for the
  Dashboard's card layout. If more Studio surfaces need responsive
  grids (Object Explorer, Search Results), consider promoting this to
  a shared, more general widget rather than each feature reinventing
  column-collapse logic.
