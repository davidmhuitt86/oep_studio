# OEP Studio

The graphical desktop application for the Open Engineering Platform.

OEP Studio is a Flutter presentation layer. It contains no engineering
business logic — every engineering operation executes through OEP
Foundation, a separate repository, via the Foundation Bridge. See
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (SDD-001) for the full architecture.

## Status

Work Package 001 (Application Shell + Dashboard) and Work Package 002
(Foundation Bridge + Open Repository Workflow) are implemented. Studio
now has a real, live connection to OEP Foundation via
`oep_foundation_bridge.dll` and `oep_api.h`. See
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for what exists today and what is
still a placeholder.

## Getting Started

Requires the Flutter stable channel and, for Windows builds, Visual
Studio Build Tools with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

Studio expects `oep_foundation` to be checked out as a sibling
directory (`../oep_foundation` relative to this repository) — see
`native/foundation_bridge/CMakeLists.txt` (`OEP_FOUNDATION_SOURCE_DIR`)
if your checkout is laid out differently.

```
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```

## Documentation

Studio Design Documents live under `docs/`:

* `ARCHITECTURE.md` (SDD-001) — Studio/Foundation boundary
* `DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md` (SDD-002) — visual identity
* `NAVIGATION_FRAMEWORK.md` (SDD-003) — navigation rail, status bar
* `WORKSPACE_FRAMEWORK.md` (SDD-004) — workspace layout and lifecycle
* `FOUNDATION_BRIDGE.md` (SDD-006) — Studio/Foundation integration boundary
* `DASHBOARD.md` (SDD-007) — Dashboard requirements
* `UI_MOCKUPS.md` — authoritative visual references
* `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` — current implementation status
