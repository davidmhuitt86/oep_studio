# OEP Studio

The graphical desktop application for the Open Engineering Platform.

OEP Studio is a Flutter presentation layer. It contains no engineering
business logic — every engineering operation executes through OEP
Foundation, a separate repository, via the Foundation Bridge. See
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (SDD-001) for the full architecture.

## Status

Work Package 001 (Application Shell + Dashboard) is implemented. See
`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` for what exists today and what is
still a placeholder.

## Getting Started

Requires the Flutter stable channel and, for Windows builds, Visual
Studio Build Tools with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.

```
flutter pub get
flutter run -d windows
```
